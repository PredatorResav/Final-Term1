 <h1><u>Site-Report</u></h1>

  <div class="gridcontainer">

  <h2><u>Objectives</u></h2>
  <div id="introS1"><fieldset>The main purpose of my website is to display my own portfolio. My curriculum vitae, as well as my personal and professional endeavors, can be found here. My site illustrates proper HTML,CSS and GitHub usage as well as a complete understanding of how a small website works.</fieldset></div>

   <h2><u>MyExperience</u></h2>
  <div id="introS2"><fieldset>Because this is my first website, I've learnt a lot of new stuff. This new experience of designing websites aided me in different aspects of HTML and CSS, as well as how to properly use GitHub. It also taught me how to design each page's individual elements. I used to think that coding was not my cup of tea.<br>

  <br>In my opinion, Many people find coding frustrating since it requires them to learn technical language and express it fluently. It's up to you to figure out what each tag means. You'll need to figure out which sections go where. You'll need to brush up on your vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. At last, we must practice it on a regular basis.</fieldset></div>

  <h2><u>Design & UI Interface</u></h2>
  <div id="introS3"><fieldset>When it comes to design and user interface, First, I figured out how my website should look by establishing a proper background where I worked with several photos until I finally settled on a color gradient. I also wondered how the finished website would look in both the responsive and non-responsive layouts.<br>
    
  </fieldset></div>

  <h2><u>GitHub Report</u></h2>
  <div id="introS4"><fieldset>For a variety of reasons, my GitHub has undergone many adjustments. I've discussed a lot of significant changes in this article.<br>
    <br>May 23, 2021 : On this day, I built the basic layout of my whole site to see how it will look like.<br>
    <br>May 24, 2021 : Initially, I put a backdrop photo, but I couldn't find much interesting, so I worked our a great color gradient inside the chrome developer option and decided on a light blue hue.<br>
    <br>May 25, 2021 : This morning, I went through every contact page on several websites to see what it looks like and what information is most necessary to keep structured so that people can simply communicate with me.<br>
    <br>May 27, 2021 :In each page, I put some basic tags and attributes for language and comments, which should make it easier for anybody to interpret my written scripts.<br>
    <br>May 28, 2021 : I used validator to verify every web page and CSS style, and I addressed my errors and warnings one by one.<br>
    <br>May 29, 2021 : I reviewed each page and the elements used on each page before summarizing the whole report, which included responsive layouts in both desktop and mobile platforms.<br>

  <br>Here, what it looks like Before and After respectively:</fieldset></div>

  <h2><u>Validation & Debugging Process</u></h2>
  <div id="introS5"><fieldset>I expected the debugging process to be more difficult, but with the assist of the validator, it was so simple that I was able to figure out any problem quickly, since it identifies where the fault is situated in the source pages' lines. In a short length of time, I could solve any issue.</fieldset></div>
